These scripts help search for homologs to putative LTR RT protein-coding domains in genome annotations.

1. Run domainSearch.py	takes a genome seq, protein ref, and PhyLTR GFF3 and does search of protein ref
			using blastp

2. Run Blast2GO on both the unknown ORFs and protein ref

3. Filter blast results from (1). You can use best_blast_hits.py which prints the first hit (which has the highest bit score)

4. Run addGOandIPS.py	takes output from (3), GFF3 with GO and IPS info, gene name to Blast2GO-mapped description, and the membership summary for a PhyLTR clustering and combines info into a table

5. Look through table for interesting things, sort it and look again, etc., look up GO terms on Amigo, etc.
	- Do certain clusters tend to have the same homologs?
